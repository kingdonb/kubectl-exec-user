# kubectl-exec-user

## Overview

Exec as a specified user into a Kubernetes container.

This works by creating a pod on the same node as the container and mounting the docker socket into this container. The container runs the docker application which has access to the hosts containers and is able to use the exec command with the user flag.

## Install

Run the install script to copy the plugin to `~/.kube/plugins`.

```
./install.sh
```

## Usage

```
kubectl plugin exec-user $POD $COMMAND
```

If the command is not specified, falls back to the `sh` command.
